Example for Completeness Score : 

Conversation:
"Customer charged ₹500 for roaming on June 10-13. 
Roaming was disabled. Agent will reverse in 24 hours."

Summary:
"Customer had roaming charge issue."

Judgment:
"Summary is missing: amount (₹500), dates (June 10-13), 
roaming status (disabled), timeline (24 hours)."



# WRONG for out use case
completeness = evaluate_completeness(conversation, judgment)
```

**Why remove:**
- Measures semantic/discourse overlap
- Judge uses different discourse (evaluative vs narrative)
- Creates false negatives (judge saying "summary is missing X" has different frames than conversation saying "X happened")

**Example of failure:**
```
Conversation: "Customer charged ₹500"
Judgment: "Summary is missing the amount (₹500)"

Completeness sees:
- Conv frame: "customer_charged_500" 
- Judge frame: "summary_missing_500"
→ No match! Low score despite judge being correct ✗
