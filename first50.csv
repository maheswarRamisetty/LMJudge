You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

AI: Hello! How can I help you today?

User: I'm interested in learning about the violin. When was it invented?

AI: The violin has a long history, dating back to the 16th century in Italy. It's believed to have originated around 1550.

User: That's really old. What's the difference between a violin and a fiddle?

AI: The main difference is in the style of music played and the setup of the instrument. A violin is often used for classical music, while a fiddle is used for folk and traditional music. The setup can also vary slightly, with fiddles often having a flatter bridge.

User: Okay, I see. Do you have any famous violinists you can recommend?

AI: Yes, one of the most famous violinists is Niccolò Paganini, an Italian composer and virtuoso from the 18th and 19th centuries. He's known for his technically challenging compositions."

AI: Hello! How can I help you today?

User: I'm going on a trip soon and I'm not sure how to pack lightly. Do you have any tips for minimalist packing?

AI: Yes, a good rule of thumb is to pack only what you can fit in a carry-on bag. Consider packing clothes that can be mixed and matched to create multiple outfits.

User: That sounds like a great idea. What about shoes - how many pairs should I bring?

AI: For a minimalist approach, it's best to bring only two or three pairs of shoes that can be worn with multiple outfits. Choose versatile options like sneakers, sandals, and a pair of dress shoes.

User: Okay, I think I can do that. What's the most important thing to remember when packing lightly?

AI: The key is to prioritize only the essentials and avoid overpacking. Remember, you can always do laundry or purchase what you need when you arrive at your destination."

You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

AI: Hello! How can I help you today?

User: I'm going to a networking event for my industry, and I'm not sure what to expect. What's the main goal of networking events?

AI: The main goal of networking events is to meet new people in your industry, build relationships, and potentially find new opportunities, such as partnerships, collaborations, or job openings.

User: That makes sense. What's a good way to start a conversation with someone I don't know at the event?

AI: A good way to start a conversation is to introduce yourself, mention how you came across the event, and ask the other person about their work or interests. You can also ask for advice or opinions on industry topics.

User: Okay, that sounds helpful. What if I don't have any business cards to hand out?

AI: If you don't have business cards, you can still exchange contact information with people you meet by asking for their card and offering to send them a LinkedIn connection request or an email with your information."
