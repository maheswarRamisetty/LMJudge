- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.

Mr. Smith resolved the immediate issue but recommended extensive electrical work, including replacing the house's wiring, which would cost around $1,000.

Conversation Summary:
The conversation revolves around the excitement and preparations for Christmas. Person 2 (Micky) and Person 3 (Emily) share their Christmas gift wishes, with Micky wanting a toy car and walkie-talkies, and Emily hoping for a Barbie radio or fragile dolls but expressing flexibility about her gifts. The group discusses how Santa will enter the house (via the chimney) and what to prepare for him and his reindeer. Suggestions include cookies, hot chocolate, apples, oranges, and bananas, though Person 1 notes that reindeer likely don’t eat cookies. Emily proposes going to bed at 7 PM to prepare for Santa’s arrival. The conversation concludes with excitement about the upcoming holiday.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Conversation Summary:
The conversation revolves around Person2's experiences and observations as an American adjusting to life in Britain. Key points include:

1. **Cultural Adjustments**:  
   - Person2 found driving on the left side of the road disorienting and dangerous initially, requiring a conscious effort to adapt.  
   - Language differences posed challenges, with British terms like ""queue"" (line), ""chips"" (French fries), and ""crisps"" (potato chips) being unfamiliar. British slang and expressions like ""mate"" and ""love"" were also new to them.

2. **Youth Culture Differences**:  
   - British youth appear more radical compared to their American counterparts, both in fashion and political awareness.  
   - Fashion differences include a preference for black clothing and men wearing earrings, which are less common in the U.S.  
   - British youth are perceived as more politically informed, particularly about global politics, compared to American youth, who tend to focus more on domestic issues.

3. **Media Influence**:  
   - Person2 attributes British youth's broader political awareness to the media's extensive coverage of U.S. policies, which significantly impact Britain. Conversely, American media provides less coverage of British policies, leading to less awareness in the U.S.

Overall, the conversation highlights cultural, linguistic, and societal contrasts between Britain and the U.S., as observed by an American adapting to life in the UK.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Overall, the conversation highlights cultural, linguistic, and societal contrasts between Britain and the U.S., as observed by an American adapting to life in the UK.","#Person1#: What were the things in Britain that you found most strange when you first arrived?
#Person2#: Well, the first thing is driving on the wrong side of the road..., that would be the- that was very strange because you have this automatic reflex when you go out into the street to look one way and a couple of times I did that and I almost got hit by cars and bikes and all, you know. It's dangerous. It really is dangerous. And you have to teach yourself to look the other way.
#Person1#: Someone said that Britain and the United States are divided by a common language. Have you had any difficulties with the language here?
#Person2#: Oh, yeah-tremendous amount of difficulty but I'm starting to pick it up now-all the lingo and slang and all those-but there's definitely a difference.
#Person1#: Can you give me any example?
#Person2#: Well, the big-I'd say some of the biggest ones would be the word 'queue' which means in America 'line'. I never heard the word 'queue' before. Um-what you call 'chips', I call 'French fries'. I never heard them called 'chips'. Urn-there's so many-urn-words that are different. Ah-' crisps' which mean ' potato chips' Yeah, that's - we call them 'potato chips' or 'chips' in America. You call them 'crisps' here. So when I heard the word 'chips', I was thinking of 'crisps' and not French fry-you know-it's very confusing but-urn-but just some of the expressions like-er-' mate' you know and 'love'. Those-you know--they're funny. You don't hear them. You don't hear them in America.
#Person1#: What about with young people-with people your own age-I mean, do you notice differences there?
#Person2#: I do notice some differences-er-I think-ah-I think the younger people in Britain are-they seem to be-much more radical than the younger people in the United States. I noticed that. Ah-the dress is different. You see a lot of-I see a lot of males here with earring in one of their-in one of their ears. You don't see that in America that much. Somet-maybe here and there, but not, not like you see it here. Ah-so many of the young people wear black-clothing-you know, I don't-you don't see the other colors. At home you see all different types of bright colors-and in England you see so much black. Especially on the women.
#Person1#: You don't like that?
#Person2#: Not really. It's just my own preference. I like-I'd rather see different colors here and there-not all-not all one color. Everyone looks like Madonna.
#Person1#: When you say 'radical'-do you-are you just thinking of clothes or of anything else?
#Person2#: Um-no, I think-er-radical as in going against the norms-could you say? Not only in clothing but I think in politics too whereas in America-er-you don't find that as much. Oh, also, another difference is the young-er-the younger people are-they're more politically aware on a larger level. See a lot of the-a lot of the Americans- they're aware of-er-government of the United States and maybe a few other countries but not as many countries in Europe or they just have a vague understanding of how those other countries are run-not as widespread. Whereas here, I think that they- er-the kids get to know about how different countries are run at a much younger level and they know all about the United States and how it's run.
#Person1#: What do you think the reasons are for that?
#Person2#: Urn-that's a good question-urn-well, I think that the reasons are-just because of the Press. You hear so much about America here that people are-they're into it-they want to know what it's about and how it's run. And so many of our policies in America affect Britain that they want to understand how policies are made and all that and seeing that that doesn't work on the other level like Britain's policies don't-I mean, they can affect us, but not to as great an extent and therefore you don't hear as much about Britain and people don't know as much about it.","The conversation revolves around Person2's experiences and observations as an American adjusting to life in Britain.

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

The conversation revolves around naming a baby. Person 1 mentions their mother's suggestion to name the baby after her, but both agree they dislike the idea. Person 1 expresses a preference for the name Laura, while Person 2 suggests strong names like Helga or Josephine to convey strength and deter unwanted attention. Person 1 counters that a name doesn't hold such power and proposes a more elegant name, Victoria, which Person 2 agrees with.

Conversation Summary:
The conversation is an interview-style discussion where Person1 asks Person2 about their strengths, weaknesses, and work preferences. Person2 highlights their mental and physical toughness, attributing it to their long-term involvement in football, including current participation in a community football club. They identify their weakness as being a workaholic, often staying late at the office. Person2 expresses no strong aversion to working with specific types of people but prefers not to work with those who prioritize chatting over productivity. Regarding work style, they are flexible, preferring to work alone due to being self-motivated but are open to teamwork when necessary.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Conversation Summary:
Steve Jackson shared his experiences from a recent trip to the Antarctic during a studio interview. He described the weather as comfortable, with temperatures around 7 degrees, and emphasized the importance of dark sunglasses due to the intense sun reflecting off the snow and ice. The ship's atmosphere was welcoming, with an American crew fostering interaction among passengers. Steve also interacted with scientists at a research station, who offered coffee and biscuits. His most cherished memory was observing the diverse birdlife in the region. He noted that while the area now appears untouched, it once had a thriving fishing industry, evidenced by abandoned buildings but no remaining equipment or boats.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

#Person1#: I guess you should take warm clothes.
#Person2#: Well, you really need that. But what I found most useful was dark sunglasses. The sun can get really strong with the reflection of the snow and the ice.

Person1 and Person2 discuss concerns about Daniel, Person2's child, who has been showing signs of depression for the past six months. Daniel has been struggling to get out of bed, has withdrawn socially, and recently experienced a breakup with his girlfriend. He was also previously bullied at school, which may have contributed to his current state. Person1 mentions alarming posts on Daniel's social media expressing despair and possible suicidal thoughts, as well as evidence of self-harm on his arms. Person2 acknowledges these issues but seems unsure of how to proceed.

Person1 strongly advises Person2 to take the situation seriously, emphasizing that six months of depression is not normal and that Daniel needs professional help. They suggest contacting crisis hotlines, taking Daniel to the hospital for a psychological assessment, and showing him love and support.

He was also previously bullied at school, which may have contributed to his current state. Person1 mentions alarming posts on Daniel's social media expressing despair and possible suicidal thoughts, as well as evidence of self-harm on his arms. Person2 acknowledges these issues but seems unsure of how to proceed.

Person1 strongly advises Person2 to take the situation seriously, emphasizing that six months of depression is not normal and that Daniel needs professional help. They suggest contacting crisis hotlines, taking Daniel to the hospital for a psychological assessment, and showing him love and support. Person1 also highlights the potential impact of a recent suicide at Daniel's school on his mental health. Person2 agrees to look into the resources and information provided by Person1 to address the situation.","#Person1#: Hey, how are you doing?
#Person2#: Uh, I guess okay ... kind of.
#Person1#: Yeah, Mom said Daniel isn't doing so well. What's going on?
#Person2#: Well, uh, for some reason I always thought raising kids would be a lot easier than it is.
#Person1#: Yeah, I know. Tell me about it. What's, what's the problem?
#Person2#: Well, for about six months, he's been really down, and sometimes, I can't get him out of bed in the morning to go to school. He just seems so depressed. I just can't figure it out.
#Person1#: So, this has been going on like half a year?
#Person2#: Yeah, kind of on and off, but I don't know. I ... I just thought it would just kind of go away, and I just thought things would just get, I don't know, get better.
#Person1#: Yeah, that's not, that's pretty worrrisome. Um, I mean, I've noticed he's not hanging out with Jared very much anymore. You know, is he ... what's he doing when he's up?
#Person2#: Well, uh, a lot of the time he's not up. He just kind of uh, stays in bed. [ Really? ] I just can't figure it out. I don't know.
#Person1#: Yeah, that's, that's a big problem. I can see why you're really worried about him. Have you considered taken him to see a therapist, or a psychologist, or anybody?
#Person2#: Ah, no. I, I ... It's probably just a phase or something. I think some kids were picking on him at school, but I think that's stopped. He doesn't talk about it anymore, so I guess that's over.
#Person1#: So, you're saying that he was like being bullied and stuff?
#Person2#: Yes, yeah. But he didn't talk about it a lot. I thought it was just, you know, having some problems, and it just kind of would go away.
#Person1#: Well, you know, I don't know about that with the bullying or whatever, but you know, this has been going on for a long time. You really need to seriously address it.
#Person2#: I don't know. Uh, and well, his girlfriend just broke up with him, so I guess maybe that's had an impact on him.
#Person1#: Yeah, it has. Uh, that explains a lot. Um, have you looked at his Facebook page lately? [ What? ] He posted some stuff, well, he was posting some stuff, I think it was last night around midnight, um, yeah, talking about how much life sucks, wishing he could just disappear. [ Oh! ] Um, you know, I can't remember exactly the words he said, but I know that it really, really worried me. Some of the things he wrote are signs of, they might be thinking about suicide.
#Person2#: Ah, I, I, I just can't figure that out. I mean, kids sometimes just talk like that. I, I, I thought. I thought that was kind of natural.
#Person1#: Yes, sometimes they do that. That's what makes it hard. Sometimes, kids just talk like that, but some of them are serious, and some of them end up talking their own lives. Some of them really do kill themselves. You know, you need to take this seriously. Six months (of being depressed) isn't normal. Six months isn't just to act like this isn't just a phase. It's, there's something going on.
#Person2#: So, any ideas? I mean, what should I do? I'm just kind of at a loss here.
#Person1#: Oh, you know. I was talking to a woman the other day about her daughter. Um, there are crisis numbers you can call. Also, you could go to the hospital; you can do to the emergency room, and they do assessments there. Psychological assessments. [ Okay. ] Um, you know, it might be kind of hard to get him out to the hospital, to get him out to go with you if you can't get him out to go to school, but you need to take this seriously. [ Yeah ... ] You could take him down to the hospital, down to the emergency room, so ...
#Person2#: I don't know.
#Person1#: You know, it's really important because you've got to get on top of it. He needs you; he needs to know that you really love him, that you're not just kind of ignoring this.
#Person2#: You know, I recently noticed that that I just saw some marks on his arms the other day, and I didn't know. I asked him about it. Kind of looked like some scratches, or something, and ...
#Person1#: I saw those too, and those aren't scratches. They're too deep to be scratches. He's doing self-harm, too.
#Person2#: Oh, man.
#Person1#: You know, um, these are really serious things, and he's crying out for help. He doesn't know how to handle what is going on in his life. He's really struggling.
#Person2#: You know, about a month ago, there was another boy in school, I think it (he) was about his age that, uh, took his own life, and I am wondering if that's had an impact on him.
#Person1#: Umm, don't you think it would have?
#Person2#: Probably. I don't know how well he knew the boy, but uh, I don't know.
#Person1#: Yeah, things like that do have an impact on kids, and you just can't run the risk. He might be mad at you for hauling him down to to the hospital, but you need help to find out what's going on, so that you can support him, and so you can make sure you are getting him all the help that he can have. These things are serious, and you don't want to look back later and say I wish I had done that.
#Person2#: Right. Well, yeah, send me that information, and uh, I'll start looking at it.

#Person1#: Dave, everyone knows that London is an exciting city for tourists. But what's it like for a teenager living there?
#Person2#: Oh, London is a great city to live in. I study at a local school and at the weekend, like all teenagers, hang around with my friends.
#Person1#: What do you do?
#Person2#: Lots of things. We go to cinemas and clubs. But what I like most is the park. At the weekend, the park is crowded with joggers and footballers. In fact, I play football there every Sunday morning with my mates.
#Person1#: What else do you enjoy doing?
#Person2#: Well, London's famous for its entertainment. There's always a music or street festival on somewhere. I really enjoy those kinds of festivals. Actually, next week, there's going to be an international Jazz festival, and if you're into theaters museums or gallery's there are plenty of those around. But to be honest, that's not really my things. Oh, of course, there are lots of good restaurants. But I seldom go there. They're too expensive for me.

Person 3 reinforces this, highlighting that premarital contracting is a valuable communication tool for couples of any age or marital history, helping to address concerns proactively rather than reactively.","#Person1#: The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that?
#Person2#: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.
#Person1#: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?
#Person3#: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.","The conversation discusses the concept of premarital contracts and addresses common misconceptions.

Both participants express frustration over the unaffordability of housing, with one noting that their monthly salary cannot even cover the cost of one square meter.
