"#Person1#: Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review. My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.
#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.
#Person2#: You have always been so soft, Dave!
#Person1#: Open your heart Dick. Don't shut us out.
#Person2#: Anyway. . . That's all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about & quot, How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot, I'm sure you'll love that one Dave!","The conversation is a movie review discussion between Richard Clarke and David Watson about *The Lion King*. Richard praises the film, highlighting its enchanting story, impressive animation, and memorable musical score by Elton John. He views it as a meaningful fable teaching values like respect, love, and the dangers of greed for power. David, on the other hand, critiques the film for its lack of originality and emotional depth, calling it predictable and linear despite its technical strengths and dramatic moments.

#Person2#: All right. One month's rent in advance, plus a month's deposit. That'll be 400 cash. This is the contract...read through it, initial each page and then sign at the bottom...
#Person1#: OK.","**Summary of the Conversation:**

Jack (#Person1#) is viewing a fully furnished rental property in London, presented by #Person2#. The property includes amenities like cable TV, broadband, a fully equipped kitchenette, and a newly renovated bathroom, with a view of the park. Initially, Jack is concerned about the size and the rent, which is £250 per week plus utility fees. He mentions that the advertisement listed £200 per week, but #Person2# clarifies that the lower price was for a smaller room that is no longer available. Jack negotiates and agrees to pay £200 per week. The agreement requires one month's rent in advance and a month's deposit (£400 total), which Jack accepts. He is instructed to review and sign the contract.","1. What amenities are included in the rental property?  
2. Why was there a discrepancy between the advertised rent and the rent discussed during the call?

Strengths of the summary include clear details about the amenities, rent discrepancies, upfront payment, and next steps for finalizing the rental agreement. However, significant weaknesses were observed in areas such as the duration of the rental contract, property availability, pet-friendliness, parking, and proximity to public transportation. A noticeable pattern is the lack of information about Jack's inquiries or concerns, as well as missing logistical details like dates and contract duration. This suggests that while the summary captured key financial and amenity-related details, it missed several contextual and participant-specific elements."",

"#Person1#: Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house. But I don't know where the best place to shop is. Can you give me some advice?
#Person2#: Sure, Carolyn. I'm happy to help you. What kinds of things do you need right now?
#Person1#: Well, we have most of the furniture already. We mostly need kitchen utensils, bathroom accessories, cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that. And Albert wants to set up a little off

#Person1#: Can I write that down?

#Person2#: And as for the kitchen things, do you want very high quality?
#Person1#: What do you mean?
#Person2#: I mean, do you want the best quality, or do you want good prices?
#Person1#: Probably good prices. You know we will only be in America for about a year.
#Person2#: Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart.
#Person1#: What are those stores?
#Person2#: They are very large, discount department stores. That means their prices are very good. And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom.
#Person1#: Even silverware?
#Person2#: Yes, everything. They don't have the most expensive brands, but their quality is usually decent. The main thing is, they have good prices, and they are very convenient.
#Person1#: I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club. Do you know about that?
#Person2#: I have never shopped there, but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store.
#Person1#: What does that mean?
#Person2#: That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there. I have heard they have very good prices on electronics.
#Person1#: Electronics?
#Person2#: Yes. Like stereos and televisions.
#Person1#: How much is the membership fee?
#Person2#: I'm not sure. But if you are only going to stay a year, I don't think Price Club is good to join. They have great deals occasionally. They are very good for people who like to buy new things all

"#Person1#: There is an element there about competition then, isn't there? Because British railways are a nationalized industry. There's only one railway system in the country. If you don't like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't go and use another.
#Person2#: Some people who write to me say this. They say that if you didn't have a monopoly, you wouldn't be able to do the things you do. Well, I don't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized.
#Person1#: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized?
#Person2#: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that.
#Person1#: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared?
#Person2#: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America. Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year. But you see, those governments are preparing to pour money into the transport system to keep it going.
#Person1#: So in a sense, you cope between two extremes. On the one hand, you're trying not to lose too much money. And on the other hand, you've got to provide the best service.
#Person2#: Yes, you are right.","The conversation discusses the challenges and implications of the nationalization of British railways. **Person1** highlights the lack of competition in a nationalized railway system, contrasting it with consumer choice in other industries. **Person2** defends nationalization, arguing that it has been beneficial for the railways, especially in the face of competition from cars. They suggest that without nationalization, the railways might have disappeared, as seen in the decline of rail systems in countries like the U.S. **Person2** also notes that other governments, such as France and Germany, heavily subsidize their railways despite significant financial losses.

"#Person1#: So Kim, have you ever had anything stolen? 
#Person2#: Stolen? No, why? 
#Person1#: My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago. I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days. 
#Person2#: Criminals are clever? They're only successful when people are careless. 
#Person1#: I don't know. The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good. 
#Person2#: If your uncle had an alarm system, then it wouldn't have happened. 
#Person1#: He did. It was one of the best ones available. But that didn't stop them from disabling it. And on a crowded street too. 
#Person2#: Didn't anyone stop them? 
#Person1#: You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that. No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen. The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away. 
#Person2#: Wow, they were good. I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all. 
#Person1#: That's not the end. They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck. ","The conversation revolves around a discussion about theft, prompted by #Person1# sharing that their uncle's motorcycle was recently stolen. #Person1# describes how the thieves cleverly disabled a high-quality alarm system and, under the guise of towing an illegally parked vehicle, managed to steal the motorcycle in plain sight on a crowded street. They even convinced a bystander to assist in loading the motorcycle into their truck. Initially skeptical, #Person2# acknowledges the ingenuity of the criminals after hearing the details.","1. How did the thieves manage to disable the high-quality alarm system on the motorcycle?  
2. What was the make and model of the stolen motorcycle?  
3. Why did the thieves pretend to be towing an illegally parked vehicle?  
4. Did #Person1# or their uncle report the theft to the authorities?  
5. How did the bystander get convinced to assist in loading the motorcycle?  
6. Was the motorcycle insured against theft?  
7. What was #Person2#'s initial reaction to the story shared by #Person1#?  
8. Were there any security cameras in the area where the theft occurred?  
9. How long did it take for the thieves to execute the theft?  
10. Did #Person1# mention if their uncle had experienced theft before?  
11. What specific details made #Person2# acknowledge the ingenuity of the criminals?  
12. Were there any witnesses who later realized the theft had occurred?  
13. How did #Person1# feel about the bystander unknowingly helping the thieves?  
14. Did the thieves face any challenges while stealing the motorcycle?  
15. What steps, if any, did #Person1# suggest to prevent such thefts in the future?  ","```json

"#Person1#: Welcome to tonight's Legendary Lives. I'm Shirley Morgan. Tonight, we are quite honored to invite David Hopkins, a well known chef with 30 years of cooking experience. Last year, his new book, Secrets in the Kitchen got on a New York Times best seller list for 6 months. Welcome to our program, David.
#Person2#: Hello, Shirley, it's a pleasure to be here.
#Person1#: David, I can't wait to see you uncovered a formulas for dishes. Exploring the How's and why's of cooking. Before that, may I ask you a question? What's the difference between a chef and a cook?
#Person2#: I think cooks generally work at entry level jobs. They work at different places in the kitchen and follow recipes. In contrast, chefs have special training and understand better which food goes well together, so they can invent new recipes.
#Person1#: I see, a chef is the cook, who has completed a professional course while a cook it's basically any person who cooks food. By the way, how do you become a chef?
#Person2#: I am trained. 95% is about professional training and the other 5% is about talent.
#Person1#: Would you mind describing us a day of a chef? We're so curious about that.
#Person2#: Nothing special, I generally go to work 2 hours before service starts. The night before, I've written the lists of all the things we need to prepare the next day. I work in different roles depending on what is needed.
#Person1#: Challenging. How long do you work everyday?
#Person2#: 10 to 12 hours a day.
#Person1#: An almost full time job! Do you have any tips for average cooks, like me?
#Person2#: Cooking involves your passion and creativity. Kitchen is never a place to chop vegetables, and have a quick breakfast. It is good to make food that people really enjoy.
#Person1#: I can't agree with you more. Miracles happen in the kitchen. Thanks for joining us, David.
#Person2#: My pleasure.","Shirley Morgan interviews renowned chef and bestselling author David Hopkins on *Legendary Lives*.

#Person1#: It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area.
#Person2#: Really? In New Berlin?
#Person1#: No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a tornado watch. That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado.
#Person2#: I understand. They think a tornado might come.
#Person1#: Yes. People should look out, because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a watch.
#Person2#: And the second stage is called a tornado warning.
#Person1#: Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, they announce a tornado warning. So if there's a tornado warning on, it means a tornado is out there somewhere.
#Person2#: It's scary.
#Person1#: Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, it's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, then we have to go in the basement.
#Person2#: What do you mean a loud train?
#Person1#: That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud.
#Person2#: But if you hear them coming, isn't it already too late?
#Person1#: Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.
#Person2#: Have you seen a lot of them?
#Person1#: I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.
#Person2#: Did it hit their house?
#Person1#: No, it didn't. But they are glad I called them.
#Person2#: What were they doing when you called?
#Person1#: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, they could have all been killed.
#Person2#: That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?
#Person1#: Not so many really. But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes.","The conversation revolves around tornado warnings and safety measures. Person1 explains the difference between a tornado watch (favorable conditions for a tornado) and a tornado warning (a tornado has been spotted). They discuss the dangers of tornadoes, their loud train-like sound, and their varying speeds, with some reaching up to 200 mph.

#Person1#: Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters?
#Person2#: They teach regular characters.
#Person1#: I see. I'm from Taiwan, so I know regular characters better than simplified.
#Person2#: You just said your English needs work, yes?
#Person1#: Yes, that's true. Especially my writing. I think my papers aren't good enough. I make too many grammatical mistakes.
#Person2#: Well, I am very serious about learning Chinese. But for me the hard part now is pronunciation. You have the four tones in Chinese. It is very hard. Maybe, if you have time, maybe we could do a language exchange.
#Person1#: You mean you and I?
#Person2#: Yes, why not? I mean, if you come to this cafe often, maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English.
#Person1#: That sounds like a good idea. How often would you like to do it?
#Person2#: Let's see. . . My schedule right now is quite busy. But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange.
#Person1#: How would we manage it though? How would we spend the 90 minutes?
#Person2#: First, we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing. If you want, I could help you edit your papers. Or we could do English conversation. Whatever you want. And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese.
#Person1#: Would I help you with writing?
#Person2#: No. For me right now, the important thing is spoken Chinese. I need practice. So you could tutor me in speaking. We could use my textbook, and you could ask me questions. Then you could correct my mistakes.
#Person1#: I think it sounds like a good system. But when is it convenient to meet?
#Person2#: Well, today is Monday. Actually, for me Monday at this time would be the best. I am free from now until 11
#Person1#: Me too. In fact, I'm free until 1
#Person2#: So if you want to meet at 10
#Person1#: It sounds good. I will bring the papers I'm working on.

#Person1#: Oh, good. You're an excellent student. I'd be very willing to help you with that.
#Person2#: Thanks. I really appreciate it. In fact, I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship.
#Person1#: What kind of scholarship is it?
#Person2#: It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association. I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American.
#Person1#: Fine. I know about that scholarship. You have to be a student in your junior year, and you have to have a grade point average of 3. 7 or higher.
#Person2#: I'm a junior now, and my GPA is 3. 92.
#Person1#: Excellent. So you'll have a good chance of getting it.
#Person2#: Well, I hope so. The competition is probably pretty heavy. And they want a writing sample too.
#Person1#: Do you have an essay you want to send them?
#Person2#: No, they want a special essay. I must write an essay on a particular question they pose.
#Person1#: What is the question?
#Person2#: They give applicants a topic. The topic is, The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society. My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced.
#Person1#: That's a pretty short essay.
#Person2#: Yes, but I need to write it by next week.
#Person1#: Good luck. I'm sure you will do a good job.
#Person2#: I came here today to talk to you because. . . Well, I need to ask two favors.
#Person1#: Sure. What are they?
#Person2#: First, I need a letter of recommendation.
#Person1#: I'd be happy to write one for you.
#Person2#: And second. . . Well, I'm not sure if it's normal.
#Person1#: What is it? Do you want me to read your essay?
#Person2#: Yes, if you could. I mean, if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes. Or maybe you'd have some suggestions.
#Person1#: Of course I could read it. That's no problem. But you need to get it to me soon.
#Person2#: I will. I want to write the first draft tonight. So I could bring it tomorrow morning.
#Person1#: Alright. If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning, I can talk with you after class on Friday. So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend.
#Person2#: That would really help me a lot. I'm very grateful.
#Person1#: Don't mention it. I'm always willing to help good students.","Alice, a junior student with a 3.92 GPA, seeks assistance from her teacher to apply for an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association.

#Person1#: Yeah. Can you tell me what facilities they have for disabled students? My wheelchair doesn't always allow me to get into buildings.
#Person2#: You should inquire at Student Services. They can discuss your medical history with you confidentially and make allowances. My friends Shannon and Rosie use computers to do their exams, so in your case, I'm sure it would not be a problem.
#Person1#: What about the wheelchair access?
#Person2#: The newer buildings have elevators and wide doors, but the older buildings have not been upgraded to accommodate handicapped people as far as I know. What faculty are you planning to go into?
#Person1#: I am thinking of doing engineering.
#Person2#: Hmm. Engineering is in the old Adams building. I don't know if there is an elevator.
#Person1#: Do the buses that go out to campus have facilities to bring wheelchairs on board?
#Person2#: Yes, that I know for sure. All the buses are equipped with electronic lifts, and there are seats that fold back.
#Person1#: What about the sidewalks?
#Person2#: I think most of the sidewalks have been leveled at the corners, so you could probably use your wheelchair, but I am not sure. In fact, if you would like, why don't you come with me? I'll be taking the bus and I could show you around once we got there.
#Person1#: That's really nice of you, Raphel. I'd really like that.

She confirms that campus buses are wheelchair-accessible and that sidewalks are mostly leveled at corners. Queenie offers to accompany Jack to the university, showing him around and helping him assess accessibility. They plan to meet at Jack's house at 8:30 AM to travel together.","1.

  ""reasoning"": ""The majority of the questions (6 out of 15) were supported by the summary, indicating that the summary provided some useful information but was incomplete overall. The summary's strengths include details about the accessibility of campus buses, the condition of sidewalks, and specific issues with older buildings like the Adams building. However, it lacked information on several key topics, such as specific accommodations Jack should inquire about, his prior actions or challenges, and other transportation options. A notable pattern is the absence of details about Jack's personal preparations, past experiences, and involvement of others in his plans. Additionally, there is a lack of clarity on newer buildings' accessibility features and whether Queenie has prior experience with the university. This suggests the summary could be improved by including more comprehensive details about Jack's situation and the university's accessibility features."",

"#Person1#: Doctor, save my baby, please
#Person2#: What symptoms does he have?
#Person1#: He has had a fever for one day. Just now at home, he had febrile convulsions with teeth and fists clenched and eyes turned up. We were at a loss what to do. We called an ambulance and brought the baby here.
#Person2#: How long did the convulsion last?
#Person1#: About 3 minutes.
#Person2#: Does he have any other complaints?
#Person1#: Three days ago, he began to cough, sneeze and have a running nose. Yesterday, he began to have a fever.
#Person2#: Have you taken his temperature?
#Person1#: It was 38 C this morning and it was 39 C just now.
#Person2#: Let me examine him to see if there is any rash. No rash.
#Person1#: Is it serious? Is it meningitis?
#Person2#: No, it is not meningitis. Just a high fever and convulsions, which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection.
#Person1#: Does he have to be admitted to hospital?
#Person2#: No. No need for admission. I'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first. Then I will give you a prescription. The pink tablets are used for his fever. When his temperature is over 38  C, give him one tablet. The other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions. The white liquid is for the cold. Give the baby plenty of water to drink.
#Person1#: Thank you very much, doctor.","A parent brought their baby to the doctor after the child experienced febrile convulsions, clenching teeth, fists, and rolling eyes, following a one-day fever. The baby also had symptoms of a cough, sneezing, and a runny nose for three days. The fever reached 39°C before arrival. The convulsion lasted about three minutes. After examination, the doctor ruled out meningitis and diagnosed a viral upper respiratory tract infection causing the fever and convulsions. Hospital admission was deemed unnecessary. The doctor prescribed medication: pink tablets for fever (to be given if the temperature exceeds 38°C), sedatives for convulsions, and white liquid for the cold. The doctor also advised giving the baby plenty of water. The parent expressed gratitude.","1. What symptoms did the baby exhibit before the febrile convulsion occurred?

Missing information includes how families are evaluated, whether students have input in family selection, meal provisions, training for families, and how cultural differences or challenges are managed. A notable pattern is the absence of details about family responsibilities, student preferences, and support mechanisms, which are critical for understanding the home-stay program.

#Person1#: I see. What is it exactly that you are interested in?
#Person2#: I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit.
#Person1#: Well, that all depends on how much you want to invest.
#Person2#: I was thinking of around 10, 000 RIB.
#Person1#: That's a nice round figure to deal with! OK, if you were to buy this insurance policy, your yearly fixed income from it would be 94. 35 RIB.
#Person2#: And for the Savings Deposit?
#Person1#: For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more. You see, in time deposit, the interest rate is 1. 58 % after the 20 % interest tax. So, technically you could get more than a third more.
#Person2#: Wow! A third more? Very good.","The conversation revolves around Person2 seeking advice on whether to invest 10,000 RIB in an insurance policy or a savings deposit. Person1 explains the options: the insurance policy would yield a fixed yearly income of 94.35 RIB, while the savings deposit, with a 1.58% interest rate after a 20% tax, would provide over a third more in returns.

#Person1#: Oh, I've heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one?
#Person2#: No, not this one. But the company has made other models to try out on business. This one is special because of its color, and the images moving.
#Person1#: Oh, that's interesting.
#Person2#: You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan. But they can only show a still black-and-white image, so this videophone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I'd want one, would you?
#Person1#: Well, no. I don't think I would. I bet it costs a lot of money. Does it say how much it costs?
#Person2#: Yes. The early black-and-white ones cost several hundred pounds. But the one is about costs several thousand pounds.
#Person1#: Hum. Why does anybody want one, do you think?
#Person2#: Business organizations that need to frequently contact overseas organizations would want it. It's like a face-to-face conversation. So maybe a lot of overseas travel can be avoided.
#Person1#: Yes, I suppose so.","The conversation revolves around a discussion about the *New Scientist* magazine and a featured article on videophones.

"#Person1#: did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA?
#Person2#: why? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that.
#Person1#: well, for many religious people, they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers.
#Person2#: do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong?
#Person1#: no, I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions.
#Person2#: it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America.
#Person1#: religious people blame it on pre-marital sex, not on abortion being illegal.
#Person2#: what do you think about abortion?
#Person1#: I personally would never want to have one, but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life, she should have the right to decide for herself.
#Person2#: do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter?
#Person1#: I know this is going to sound sexist, but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children.
#Person2#: why not? It's their children, too.
#Person1#: that may be true, but when a woman gets pregnant, it changes her life completely. Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand.
#Person2#: that might be true, but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter.","The conversation revolves around the topic of abortion, focusing on its legality, societal views, and personal opinions. Person 1 highlights that abortion remains illegal in many U.S. states, largely due to religious beliefs equating it to murder. They suggest that opposition to abortion is more prevalent among the older generation. Person 2 links the issue to high teenage pregnancy rates, which Person 1 attributes to religious opposition to pre-marital sex rather than abortion laws.

Person 1 shares their personal stance, stating they would not choose abortion but believe women should have the right to decide due to the life-altering impact of pregnancy. When Person 2 raises the question of fathers' involvement in the decision, Person 1 argues that men’s lives are less affected by pregnancy and childbirth, while Person 2 counters that fathers should still have some say, as it concerns their children too.

#Person2#: Well, I'm an English major, you know. So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things. 
#Person1#: Good. I think it's a good idea. Our department should require meetings like this. 
#Person2#: I want to finish my degree in four years. So I don't want to forget to take classes I need. I have a friend who has to stay in college another year. She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate. She didn't know about them. 
#Person1#: Yes, that happens. 
#Person2#: I brought my transcript from my first year. Here. And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall. 
#Person1#: Alright. Good. I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements. You have one botany class and one chemistry class. And political science. So that's nine credits. Did you take English Composition 201? 
#Person2#: No, I don't need to. I took Advanced Placement English in high school. So I'm not required to take composition. 
#Person1#: Excellent. I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester. And the modern novel class. You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet. 
#Person2#: No, I thought I would take it later. 
#Person1#: Actually, I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later. 
#Person2#: Well, I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class. I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets. 
#Person1#: Let me look at the timetable. Shakespeare meets Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11 
#Person2#: I can take it then. I have that time slot free. 
#Person1#: Good. I recommend it. Shakespeare is of course enormously important. We want our students to take the class as soon as they can. And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher. 
#Person2#: I'll take it then. 
#Person1#: Tell me, Lisa, what made you decide to be an English major?
