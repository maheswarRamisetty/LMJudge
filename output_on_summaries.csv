Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.

You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

Conversation Summary:
A user planning to move to Japan asked about key cultural norms and gift-giving. The assistant highlighted respect for elders, removing shoes in homes and some restaurants, and explained omiyage customs, including modestly priced, well-wrapped gifts and receiving them with both hands and a slight bow.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

Conversation Summary:
The user asked how compasses work and whether strong magnets affect them; the assistant explained that a magnetized needle aligns with Earth’s magnetic north and that nearby magnets can distort it.

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.

===============================================================
STEP 3 — Reasoning About Informativeness
===============================================================
Write a short paragraph (2–8 sentences) that:
- Evaluates how informative the summary is **based ONLY on the 15 QnA pairs**.
- Describe what information appears included (based on ""Information Available"").
- Describe what information appears missing (based on ""Information Missed in the summary"").
- Identify patterns in missing or present content.
- You MAY reference the summary only to contextualize what is present or missing.

===============================================================
STEP 4 — Output JSON (REASONING COMES FIRST)
===============================================================
Return ONLY the following JSON object.
**CRITICAL: Output as COMPACT/MINIFIED JSON (no newlines, no indentation).**

{""reasoning"":""<string>"",""table_data"":[{""Question"":""<string>"",""Answer"":""<string>"",""Status"":""<string>""}]}

Hard Requirements:
- reasoning must come BEFORE table_data.
- table_data must contain exactly 15 items.
- Keys must match exactly. No extra fields.
- Do not add any whitespace, newlines, or indentation.
- STOP after producing the JSON.

You are an intelligent evaluator. Your task is to assess how informative a given summary is.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

You are an analytical assistant. You will receive a Conversation Summary.
You must follow ALL instructions and output ONLY a valid JSON object in the exact required format.

===============================================================
STEP 1 — Generate 15 Completely Distinct Questions
===============================================================
Create EXACTLY 15 questions about the summary.

Choose ONE distribution at random:
• 6 answerable + 9 unanswerable
• 7 answerable + 8 unanswerable
• 8 answerable + 7 unanswerable
• 9 answerable + 6 unanswerable

STRICT QUESTION RULES:
- Every question must target a different piece of information.
- NO duplicates, NO paraphrasing, NO overlapping meaning, and NO semantic similarity.
- All 15 questions must be unique in topic, structure, and intent.
- Answerable: information must appear explicitly in the summary.
- Unanswerable: ask for details NOT present in the summary
  (names, dates, reasons, numbers, locations, background info, etc.).
- Mix answerable and unanswerable questions in random/natural order.
- Yes/no questions are allowed BUT must still follow uniqueness rules.

===============================================================
STEP 2 — Answer Each Question
===============================================================
When information IS present:
    - Provide the exact factual answer.
    - Status = ""Information Available"".

When information is NOT present:
    - Answer = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - Status = ""Information Missed in the summary""
    - EXACT string, no period, no extra words.

Do NOT infer, guess, assume, or add details not explicitly stated.
